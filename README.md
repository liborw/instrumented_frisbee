# Instrumented Frisbee

This repository contains notes, protocols and dataset for the instrumented frisbee.

## Hardware

The sensor is cheap chinese board based on NRF51820 with MPU6050 6-dof IMU, powered by coin cell battery weighting g. It was programed to send Accelerometer and Gyroscope data over BLE.
